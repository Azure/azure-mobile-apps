# Add Authentication

In this tutorial, you add Microsoft authentication to the quickstart project using Azure Active Directory. Before completing this tutorial, ensure you have [created the project](./index.md) and [enabled offline sync](./offline.md).

{!quickstarts/includes/quickstart-configure-auth.md!}

## Test that authentication is being requested

* Open your project in Visual Studio. 
* From the **Run** menu, click **Run app**.
* Verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.

This exception happens because the app attempts to access the back end as an unauthenticated user, but the *TodoItem* table now requires authentication.

## Add authentication to the app


You can now run the app.  It will prompt you for a Microsoft credential prior to showing you the list of items.

## Test the app

From the **Run** menu, click **Run app** to start the app.  You will be prompted for a Microsoft account.  When you are successfully signed in, the app should run as before without errors.

> **Deleting the resources**
>
> Now you have completed the quickstart tutorial, you can delete the resources with `az group delete -n zumo-quickstart`. You can also delete the global app registration used for authentication through the portal.

## Next steps

Take a look at the HOW TO sections:

* Server ([Node.js](../../howto/server/nodejs.md) or [ASP.NET Framework](../../howto/server/dotnet-framework.md)
* [.NET Client](../../howto/client/dotnet.md)

You can also do a Quick Start for another platform using the same backend server:

* [Android](../android/index.md)
* [Apache Cordova](../cordova/index.md)
* [iOS](../ios/index.md)
* [Windows (UWP)](../uwp/index.md)
* [Xamarin.Android](../xamarin-android/index.md)
* [Xamarin.Forms](../xamarin-forms/index.md)
* [Xamarin.iOS](../xamarin-ios/index.md)
