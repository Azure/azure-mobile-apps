# Azure Mobile Apps

Azure Mobile Apps is a set of client and server libraries for adding authenticated data access and offline synchronization to your mobile applications.  The server side is a Node.js or ASP.NET Framework web API that runs on [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/).  The client side contains everything necessary to provide offline sync for your Android, iOS, UWP, or Xamarin application.

To get started, take a look at [our documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-mobile-apps).
